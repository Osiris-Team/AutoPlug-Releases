## Releases
- [Download latest stable AutoPlug-Client.jar.](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/AutoPlug-Releases/raw/master/stable-builds/AutoPlug-Client.jar)
- [Download latest beta AutoPlug-Client.jar.](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/AutoPlug-Releases/raw/master/beta-builds/AutoPlug-Client.jar) 



## Steps (first install)
The recommended/easiest way of installation is via the installer at https://autoplug.one/installer.
If you don't want to, follow the steps below:
- If you want to test it first or create a new server, put the jar into a new empty directory. Otherwise put it into your server root, where your server jar is located.
- Create a start script with `java -jar AutoPlug-Client.jar` inside, run it and you are done.

## Steps (install update)
Updating AutoPlug is pretty easy if you have the self-updater enabled (it is by default), so update by...
- ...waiting for your server to restart.
- ...entering .r to restart your server.
- ...downloading and installing the release manually from https://github.com/Osiris-Team/AutoPlug-Releases

## Notes
- This is the only, official downloads repository. Do not download for anywhere else.
- Beta releases contain experimental, poorly tested features, which may not work properly.
