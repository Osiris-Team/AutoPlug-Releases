# Development builds
Download AutoPlug development beta builds here!
 - Currently latest dev-version: 0.5 (25.05.2020)
 
 Changes since v0.4:
[!] Please update your configs! Big changes!
[!] The AutoPlugPlugin.jar now is only responsible for gathering the plugin data, aswell as sorting out plugins with missing information and excluding plugins from the "excluded-plugins" list (config.yml)
[!] The AutoPlug.jar is now responsible for downloading the updates and managing profiles/file transfers (so move your server key to the autoplug-config.yml)
